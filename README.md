# cdiff
During development, most commits contains a few tweaks and refactorings of the code.
It is sometime difficult to identify the actual change between two versions (side-by-side like sdiff or top-bottom like git diff) and the eyes have to move around to checks there is no surprise.

The goal of cdiff (Compact DIFF) is to propose a more readable diff, ideally on a single line using colors.
